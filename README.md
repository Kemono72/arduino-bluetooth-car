# Arduino Bluetooth RC Car 🚗📡

A custom-built Arduino-powered remote control car, operated via Bluetooth using an HC-05 module and mobile app interface. Built at age 15 to explore embedded systems, robotics and wireless communication i was fascinated with motors back then 😂.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- HC-05 Bluetooth module
- L298N motor driver
- 2x DC motors
- Chassis and wheels
- 9V battery
- Android phone + Bluetooth Serial Controller app

## 📲 How It Worked
- The car received movement commands via Bluetooth from a mobile app.
- The Arduino parsed the commands and activated motors through the L298N driver.
- Directional buttons controlled forward, backward, left, right movement.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Serial communication over Bluetooth
- Motor control using Arduino PWM
- Power management for mobile robotics
- Basics of embedded software and prototyping

> This was one of my first hands-on hardware/software projects and ignited my passion for smart systems and automation.
